## Platform Konversi dan Optimasi Kode Multi-Bahasa

CodeForge is a powerful web-based platform for code conversion, optimization, and analysis across multiple programming languages. This tool helps developers translate code between different languages, optimize existing code, disassemble binary files, and experiment with code in an interactive playground.

## Features

### 1. Code Conversion

Translate your code between multiple programming languages:
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Lua
- Bash

Simply paste your source code, select the target language, and let CodeForge handle the conversion.

### 2. Code Optimization

Improve your code's performance and readability with our optimization tools:
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Suggest code improvements
- Analyze code complexity
- Optimize resource usage

### 3. Disassembler

Convert binary files back to assembly code for analysis:
- Upload executable files (.exe, .dll)
- Upload shared objects (.so)
- Upload other binary files (.bin)
- View the disassembled code with syntax highlighting

### 4. Code Playground

Test and experiment with code directly in your browser:
- Write and run code in multiple languages
- See output in real-time
- Test code snippets quickly
- Perfect for learning and experimentation
